Billefjorden Group,/t,billefjorden group,/t,,/t,Billefjorden Group,/t,"On the Finnmark Platform, medium- to coarse-grained, occasionally conglomeratic, sandstones and minor siltstones and coals dominate the basal part of the succession represented by the Soldogg Formation. These are overlain by a succession of stacked metre-scale fining-upward cycles of sandstone, siltstone, claystone and coal assigned to the Tettegras Formation. The upper part of the group, represented by the Bl√¶rerot Formation, is characterised by a basal unit of fossiliferous limestones, overlain by marine shales and fine- to medium-grained, fluvial and shallow marine sandstones. Sediments tentatively assigned to the group are very differently developed on the Loppa High where well 7120/2-1 penetrated 847 m of varicoloured arkosic breccias, conglomerates, ignimbrites and other types of volcanoclastic deposits (Fig 9.10). The basal 115 m are dominated by brownish siltstone and mudstone. The red nature of these sediments, together with their high content of volcanoclastics, makes them anomalous representatives of the Billefjorden Group in this area, although palynomorphs indicate an early Carboniferous age (Vis√©an PU to VF Miospore zones from 3467 to 2682 m and early Serpukhovian TK Zone from 2645 to 2630 m) (Lindstr√∂m, in press). The only other arctic areas where lower Carboniferous red beds have been found are in the northern part of eastern Greenland (Stemmerik et al. 1993), but even there the change to red beds appears to have occurred in the late Tournaisian ‚Äì i.e. older than the earliest datings on the Loppa High. The Loppa sequence‚Äôs overall lithology and tectonic setting seems rather to suggest closer affinities to the lowermost clastics of the overlying mid-Carboniferous Gipsdalen Group. More work is clearly needed on this problem, especially in view of this representing the only occurrence of volcanoclastics in the Upper Palaeozoic of the Barents Shelf; we note that dolerite dykes of probable mid- to late Carboniferous age have been reported by Lippard & Prestvik (1997) on Mager√∏y in Finnmark and mid-Carboniferous volcanics have also been identified on the adjacent Kola peninsula in northern Russia (Ulmishek 1982). In view of these uncertainties, this sequence has not yet been defined as a formational unit, and its assignment to the Billefjorden Group is still tentative. ",/t,"The Billefjorden Group has been assigned to the Famennian to Vis√©an in the onshore areas of Bj√∏rn√∏ya and Spitsbergen (Dallmann et al. 1999; Worsley et al. 2001). The offshore development has been dated to the Vis√©an to early Serpukhovian. On the Finnmark Platform, palynomorphs suggest that the basal part of the group is of middle to late Vis√©an age (Bugge et al. 1995), i.e. significantly younger than the Famennian to Tournaisian age recorded for the basal sediments onshore. The upper part of the group is apparently of late Vis√©an to early Serpukhovian age (Bugge et al. 1995; Simon-Robertson 1992 and Geochem Group 1994).

Ula Formation,/t,ula formation,/t,vestland group,/t,Ula Formation,/t,"In the type well the Ula Formation is a generally massive, fine to medium grained, grey sandstone. A thin, dark grey siltstone is present in the basal part of the formation. The sandstones are arkosic to subarkosic, glauconitic and micaceous. Sorting and angularity vary between individual units of the formation. Bivalve shells and belemnite debris occur, often concentrated in thin lag deposits. Thin, nodular calcite-cemented bands are common.^Within the Ula Field the Ula Formation can be subdivided into a number of units on the basis of large scale coarsening upward and fining upward cycles (Bailey et al., op. cit.). The sandstones are extensively bioturbated throughout, and this usually obliterates smaller scale sedimentary features. However, in rare zones, parallel or low angle inclined lamination and planar cross bedding are preserved. ",/t,"Oxfordian to Ryazanian. In the region of the Ula Field the sands are Oxfordian to Early Volgian in age. Around the fringes of the J√¶ren and Mandal Highs and locally on the Southern Vestland Arch, developments of the formation may be as young as Middle/Late Volgian or possibly Ryazanian. "
Ulv Formation,/t,ulv formation,/t,bjarmeland group,/t,Ulv Formation,/t,"Dark fine-grained bioclastic limestones dominate the formation. The dominant microfacies are bryozoan-crinoidal wackestones and more rarely packstones. Additional faunal elements include siliceous sponges, brachiopods and rare fusulinids. The limestone is thinly bedded and often contains thin silt laminae. Shales and silty limestones are locally abundant and chert nodules occur locally. The formation includes thin, less than 15 m, units of coarser grained bioclastic limestone that lithologically resemble the overlying Isbj√∏rn Formation‚Äôs dominant lithologies.
