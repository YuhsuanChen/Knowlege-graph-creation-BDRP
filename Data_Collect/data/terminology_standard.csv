"1. distance from type area ^ 2. change in meaning of the term ""Kimmeridge Clay Formation"" from area to area ^The type area for the Kimmeridge Clay Formation is Kimmeridge Bay in Dorset, southern England (e.g. Arkell 1947). There the unit consists of dark, organic-rich claystones of Kimme-ridgian to Volgian age (using Boreal stage terminology). The term was extended by Rhys (1974 and 1975) into the Southern North Sea to describe a unit of comparable age overlying Oxfordian limestones (Corallian Formation) in type well 47/15-1. Deegan and Scull (1977) further extended the Kimmeridge Clay into the Northern North Sea to denote a generally highly radioactive, generally low velocity claystone sequence. The age range of the formation was broadened to include part of the Oxfordian and Ryazanian. It was remarked that the sediments in the Southern North Sea were less radioactive (less than 60 A.P.I, units compared with 100-200 A.P.I, units in the north). However, the low seismic velocities shown by both units were considered sufficient grounds to justify a correlation.^Deegan and Scull did not specifically discuss the application of the term ""Kimmeridge Clay"" to the Central Graben region of the Central North Sea. Nevertheless, the name is in common usage there (e.g. Ofstad, 1983). It has, among other meanings, been taken to denote: ^ 3. all claystones of Upper Jurassic age regardless of log character, or more usually ^ 4. only the upper, most highly radioactive claystone unit of Volgian-Ryazanian age ^To the northwest, in the Norwegian-Danish Basin, a similar deposit is present (the Tau Formation, described in this publication). This unit has never been referred to the Kimmeridge Clay Formation but is nevertheless a typical Upper Jurassic organic shale. It is of Kimmeridgian — Volgian age and occupies a lower relative position in the overall Upper Jurassic shale sequence than the Central Graben ""hot shales"". (Table 3.4). A connection between the two deposits across the Southern Vestland Arch is most unlikely.^In extending the Kimmeridge Clay Formation from the type area to the Northern North Sea (a distance of approximately 1300 km) the stratigraphic meaning of the name has varied considerably (Table 3.5). It is recognised that deposits of this type were laid down over a very wide area in intervals of the late Jurassic, the widespread deoxygenated bottom conditions reflecting the combined effect of paleo-geography with general sea level rise (e.g. Tyson et al., 1979; Ziegler 1982). However, acceptance of this overall regime should not alone be taken as a basis for lithostratigraphic classification. The nature and timing of the organic shales appears to have varied according to the evolution of individual basins. Use of the generic term Kimmeridge Clay Formation is a potential cause of mistaken correlation and does not further understanding of inter-basin relationships. Replacement of the name is a more palatable alternative to its continued extension northwards to the Arctic and Russia, where alternative nomenclature already exists.^It therefore seems appropriate to limit the ""Kimmeridge Clay Formation"" of the North Sea to to the area south of the Mid-North Sea High, as described by Rhys (1974). The Norwegian Lithostratigraphic Nomenclature Committee proposes substitution of the name ""Draupne Formation"" for the ""Kimmeridge Clay Formation"" of the Northern North Sea as defined by De-egan and Schull (1977). It is suggested that the name ""Mandal Formation"" should be applied specifically to the ""hot"" shales of Volgian — Ryazanian age in the Central Graben region (Table 4), following the precedent set by Hamar et al., (1982). ^Source",(N/A)
